Certainly! Below is a JUnit 4 test suite for the `Timer` class. This suite tests the `start` and `isCounting` methods to ensure they behave as expected.

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.mockito.internal.util.Timer;

public class TimerTest {

    private static final long DURATION = 1000; // 1 second
    private Timer timer;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        timer = new Timer(DURATION);
    }

    @Test
    public void testTimerIsNotCountingBeforeStart() {
        try {
            timer.isCounting();
            fail("Expected an AssertionError because the timer has not been started.");
        } catch (AssertionError e) {
            // Expected behavior
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testTimerIsCountingAfterStart() throws InterruptedException {
        timer.start();
        assertTrue("Timer should be counting immediately after start.", timer.isCounting());
    }

    @Test
    public void testTimerStopsCountingAfterDuration() throws InterruptedException {
        timer.start();
        Thread.sleep(DURATION + 100); // Wait slightly longer than the duration
        assertFalse("Timer should not be counting after the duration has passed.", timer.isCounting());
    }

    @Test
    public void testTimerIsCountingDuringDuration() throws InterruptedException {
        timer.start();
        Thread.sleep(DURATION / 2); // Wait for half the duration
        assertTrue("Timer should still be counting halfway through the duration.", timer.isCounting());
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`setUp` Method**: Initializes a `Timer` instance with a duration of 1 second before each test.
- **`testTimerIsNotCountingBeforeStart`**: Ensures that calling `isCounting` before `start` throws an `AssertionError`.
- **`testTimerIsCountingAfterStart`**: Verifies that the timer is counting immediately after `start` is called.
- **`testTimerStopsCountingAfterDuration`**: Confirms that the timer stops counting after the specified duration has elapsed.
- **`testTimerIsCountingDuringDuration`**: Checks that the timer is still counting when checked halfway through the duration.

This test suite covers the basic functionality of the `Timer` class, ensuring that it behaves correctly under different conditions.
