    }

    @Test
    public void testTimerStopsCountingAfterDuration() throws InterruptedException {
        timer.start();
        Thread.sleep(durationMillis + 100); // Sleep a bit longer than the duration
        assertFalse("Timer should not be counting after duration has passed", timer.isCounting());
    }

    @Test
    public void testTimerIsCountingDuringDuration() throws InterruptedException {
        timer.start();
        Thread.sleep(durationMillis / 2); // Sleep for half the duration
        assertTrue("Timer should still be counting during the duration", timer.isCounting());
    }
}
```

This test suite covers the following scenarios:
- The timer should not be counting before it is started.
- The timer should be counting immediately after it is started.
- The timer should stop counting after the specified duration has passed.
- The timer should still be counting if checked during the countdown period.
