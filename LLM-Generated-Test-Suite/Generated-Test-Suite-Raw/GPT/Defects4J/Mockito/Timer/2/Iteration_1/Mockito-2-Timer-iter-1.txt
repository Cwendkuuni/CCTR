    }

    @Test
    public void testTimerIsCountingJustBeforeDurationEnds() throws InterruptedException {

This test suite includes tests for the `Timer` class to ensure that it behaves as expected. It checks the behavior before starting the timer, immediately after starting, just before the duration ends, and after the duration has passed. The tests also handle the assertion error expected when `isCounting` is called before the timer is started.
