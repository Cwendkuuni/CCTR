To create a comprehensive JUnit 4 test suite for the `MockCandidateFilter` interface, we need to consider that interfaces cannot be directly instantiated. Therefore, we would typically create a mock or a concrete implementation of this interface to test its behavior. Since the interface is part of a package that seems to be related to Mockito, we can use Mockito to create a mock implementation for testing purposes.

Below is a JUnit 4 test suite that uses Mockito to test the `MockCandidateFilter` interface. This test suite assumes that you have a concrete implementation or are using a mock to simulate the behavior of the interface.

```java
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import org.mockito.junit.MockitoJUnitRunner;
import org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.filter.MockCandidateFilter;
import org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.filter.OngoingInjecter;

import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Collections;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
public class MockCandidateFilterTest {

    @Mock
    private OngoingInjecter ongoingInjecter;

    @InjectMocks
    private MockCandidateFilter mockCandidateFilter = mock(MockCandidateFilter.class);

    private Collection<Object> mocks;
    private Field fieldToBeInjected;
    private Object fieldInstance;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws NoSuchFieldException {
        mocks = Collections.singletonList(new Object());
        fieldToBeInjected = SampleClass.class.getDeclaredField("sampleField");
        fieldInstance = new Object();

        when(mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, fieldToBeInjected, fieldInstance))
                .thenReturn(ongoingInjecter);
    }

    @Test
    public void testFilterCandidate() {
        OngoingInjecter result = mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, fieldToBeInjected, fieldInstance);
        assertNotNull("The result should not be null", result);
        verify(mockCandidateFilter, times(1)).filterCandidate(mocks, fieldToBeInjected, fieldInstance);
    }

    // Sample class to provide a field for reflection
    private static class SampleClass {
        private Object sampleField;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **MockitoJUnitRunner**: This runner is used to initialize mocks and inject them into the test class.

2. **Mocks and InjectMocks**: We create a mock for `OngoingInjecter` and use `InjectMocks` to inject it into our `MockCandidateFilter` mock. This setup allows us to simulate the behavior of the `filterCandidate` method.

3. **setUp Method**: This method initializes the test data, including a collection of mock objects, a field to be injected (using reflection), and a field instance. It also sets up the behavior of the `filterCandidate` method using `when...thenReturn`.

4. **testFilterCandidate Method**: This test method verifies that the `filterCandidate` method returns a non-null `OngoingInjecter` and that it is called exactly once with the specified parameters.

5. **SampleClass**: A simple class with a field is used to provide a `Field` object for testing.

This test suite provides a basic framework for testing the `MockCandidateFilter` interface. You can expand it by adding more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases as needed.
