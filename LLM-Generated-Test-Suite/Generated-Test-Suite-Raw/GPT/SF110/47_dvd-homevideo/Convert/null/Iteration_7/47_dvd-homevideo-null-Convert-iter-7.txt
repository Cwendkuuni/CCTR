To create a comprehensive JUnit 4 test suite for the `Convert` class, we need to consider testing the constructors, the `init` method, the `Transcode` method, and the `matrix` method. However, due to the complexity and dependencies on external systems and GUI components, some methods might require mocking or stubbing. Below is a basic test suite that outlines how you might begin testing this class. Note that this is a starting point, and further tests should be added to cover more edge cases and scenarios.

```java
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

import java.io.File;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

public class ConvertTest {

    private GUI mockGUI;
    private Convert convert;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        mockGUI = mock(GUI.class);
        when(mockGUI.strOutputDir).thenReturn("output");
        when(mockGUI.menuChkThread.isSelected()).thenReturn(false);
        when(mockGUI.spnMinutes.getValue()).thenReturn(0);
        when(mockGUI.spnSeconds.getValue()).thenReturn(0);
    }

    @Test
    public void testConstructorWithFormatAndAspectRatio() {
        convert = new Convert("dvd-ntsc", "16:9", mockGUI);
        assertEquals("dvd-ntsc", convert.m_Format);
        assertEquals("16:9", convert.m_AspectRatio);
        assertEquals(29.97, convert.m_fps, 0.01);
    }

    @Test
    public void testConstructorWithQualityFormatAndAspectRatio() {
        convert = new Convert(1, "dvd-pal", "4:3", mockGUI);
        assertEquals(1, convert.m_Quality);
        assertEquals("dvd-pal", convert.m_Format);
        assertEquals("4:3", convert.m_AspectRatio);
        assertEquals(25.0, convert.m_fps, 0.01);
    }

    @Test
    public void testInitWithoutThread() {
        convert = new Convert("dvd-ntsc", "16:9", mockGUI);
        boolean result = convert.init();
        assertFalse(result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testMatrix() {
        convert = new Convert("dvd-ntsc", "16:9", mockGUI);
        convert.matrix();
        File matrixFile = new File("output/matrix.txt");
        assertTrue(matrixFile.exists());
        matrixFile.delete(); // Clean up after test
    }

    // Additional tests can be added here to cover more scenarios and edge cases.
}
```

### Notes:
1. **Mocking**: The `GUI` class is mocked using Mockito to isolate the `Convert` class from its dependencies. This allows us to test the `Convert` class without needing a full GUI implementation.

2. **File Operations**: The `matrix` method writes to a file. The test checks for the existence of this file to verify that the method works as expected. After the test, the file is deleted to clean up.

3. **Threading**: The `init` method's behavior changes based on whether threading is enabled. The test currently assumes threading is disabled. If threading is enabled, additional synchronization and checks would be needed.

4. **Complex Methods**: The `Transcode` method is complex and interacts with the file system and external processes. Testing this method would require more advanced techniques such as mocking file operations and process execution.

This test suite is a starting point and should be expanded to cover more scenarios, especially for the `Transcode` method, which is not tested here due to its complexity and side effects.
