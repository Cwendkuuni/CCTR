Certainly! Below is a JUnit 4 test suite for the `Game` class. This suite aims to comprehensively test all the methods in the class. Note that this assumes the existence of mock or stub implementations for the `Player`, `UserInterface`, `CardCollection`, `Card`, `Combat`, `Phase`, `UntapPhase`, and `Stack` classes/interfaces, as they are not provided in the original code.

    @Before
    public void setUp() {

### Explanation:
- **Mocks and Stubs**: The test suite uses Mockito to create mock objects for dependencies like `UserInterface`, `CardCollection`, `Player`, `Card`, and `Stack`.
- **Setup**: The `setUp` method initializes the mock objects and sets up the `Game.stack` with a mock `Stack`.
- **Test Methods**: Each method in the `Game` class has a corresponding test method that verifies its behavior using assertions and Mockito verifications.
- **Priority Handling**: The `testGivePriorityToCurrentPlayer` and `testGivePriorityToCurrentPlayerWithStack` methods test the priority handling logic, including scenarios where the stack is not empty.

This test suite should provide a comprehensive check of the `Game` class's functionality, assuming the existence of the necessary classes and interfaces.
