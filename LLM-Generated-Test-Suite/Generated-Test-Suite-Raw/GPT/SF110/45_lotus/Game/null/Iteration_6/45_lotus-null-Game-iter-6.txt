Certainly! Below is a JUnit 4 test suite for the `Game` class. This suite aims to comprehensively test the methods within the class. Note that some methods rely on external classes and interfaces, so mock objects or simple stubs are used to facilitate testing.

### Explanation:
- **Mocking**: The test suite uses Mockito to create mock objects for `UserInterface`, `CardCollection`, `Player`, and `Card` to simulate interactions without needing actual implementations.
- **Setup**: The `setUp` method initializes the mock objects and sets up their behavior.
- **Tests**: Each method in the `Game` class has a corresponding test method that verifies its behavior under different conditions.
- **Assertions**: The tests use assertions to verify that the state and behavior of the `Game` class are as expected after method calls.
- **Priority Handling**: The `givePriorityToCurrentPlayer` method is tested both with an empty stack and with a non-empty stack to ensure it behaves correctly in both scenarios.
