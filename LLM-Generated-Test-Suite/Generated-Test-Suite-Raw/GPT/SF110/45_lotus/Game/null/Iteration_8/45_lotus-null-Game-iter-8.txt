Certainly! Below is a JUnit 4 test suite for the `Game` class. This suite aims to cover the methods provided in the class, including initialization and player interactions.

public class GameTest {

    private UserInterface mockUI1;
    private UserInterface mockUI2;
    private CardCollection mockDeck1;
    private CardCollection mockDeck2;
    private Player mockPlayer1;
    private Player mockPlayer2;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        mockUI1 = Mockito.mock(UserInterface.class);
        mockUI2 = Mockito.mock(UserInterface.class);
        mockDeck1 = Mockito.mock(CardCollection.class);
        mockDeck2 = Mockito.mock(CardCollection.class);
        mockPlayer1 = Mockito.mock(Player.class);
        mockPlayer2 = Mockito.mock(Player.class);

        // Initialize the Game with mock objects
        Game.init(mockUI1, mockUI2, "Player1", "Player2", mockDeck1, mockDeck2);
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetPlayingPlayer() {
        Game.playingPlayer = 1;
        assertEquals(Game.player1, Game.getPlayingPlayer());

        Game.playingPlayer = 2;
        assertEquals(Game.player2, Game.getPlayingPlayer());
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetNonPlayingPlayer() {
        Game.playingPlayer = 1;
        assertEquals(Game.player2, Game.getNonPlayingPlayer());

        Game.playingPlayer = 2;
        assertEquals(Game.player1, Game.getNonPlayingPlayer());
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetOtherPlayer() {
        assertEquals(Game.player2, Game.getOtherPlayer(Game.player1));
        assertEquals(Game.player1, Game.getOtherPlayer(Game.player2));
    }

    @Test
    public void testInit() {
        assertNotNull(Game.player1);
        assertNotNull(Game.player2);
        assertEquals("Player1", Game.player1.getName());
        assertEquals("Player2", Game.player2.getName());
        assertEquals(1, Game.playingPlayer);
        assertTrue(Game.currentPhase instanceof UntapPhase);
    }

    @Test
    public void testGivePriorityToCurrentPlayer() {
        // Mock the letPlayerSpeak method to return false to simulate players passing priority
        Mockito.when(Game.player1.letPlayerSpeak()).thenReturn(false);
        Mockito.when(Game.player2.letPlayerSpeak()).thenReturn(false);

        // Ensure stack is empty before calling the method
        assertTrue(Game.stack.empty());

        // Call the method
        Game.givePriorityToCurrentPlayer();

        // Verify that letPlayerSpeak was called on both players
        Mockito.verify(Game.player1, Mockito.atLeastOnce()).letPlayerSpeak();
        Mockito.verify(Game.player2, Mockito.atLeastOnce()).letPlayerSpeak();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Mocking**: The test suite uses Mockito to create mock objects for `UserInterface`, `CardCollection`, and `Player`. This allows us to simulate interactions without needing actual implementations.
- **Setup**: The `setUp` method initializes the `Game` class with mock objects before each test.
- **Tests**:
  - `testGetPlayingPlayer` and `testGetNonPlayingPlayer` verify that the correct player is returned based on the `playingPlayer` variable.
  - `testGetOtherPlayer` checks that the method correctly identifies the non-playing player.
  - `testInit` ensures that the `init` method correctly initializes the game state.
  - `testGivePriorityToCurrentPlayer` simulates the priority passing between players and verifies that the method behaves as expected when the stack is empty.

This test suite provides a comprehensive check of the `Game` class's functionality using JUnit 4.
