Certainly! Below is a JUnit 4 test suite for the `Game` class. This suite aims to comprehensively test the methods within the class. Note that some methods rely on other classes and interfaces, so mock objects or simple implementations are used where necessary.

public class GameTest {

    private UserInterface mockUI1;
    private UserInterface mockUI2;
    private CardCollection mockDeck1;
    private CardCollection mockDeck2;
    private Player mockPlayer1;
    private Player mockPlayer2;
    private Card mockCard1;
    private Card mockCard2;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        mockUI1 = Mockito.mock(UserInterface.class);
        mockUI2 = Mockito.mock(UserInterface.class);
        mockDeck1 = Mockito.mock(CardCollection.class);
        mockDeck2 = Mockito.mock(CardCollection.class);
        mockPlayer1 = Mockito.mock(Player.class);
        mockPlayer2 = Mockito.mock(Player.class);
        mockCard1 = Mockito.mock(Card.class);
        mockCard2 = Mockito.mock(Card.class);

        Mockito.when(mockDeck1.iterator()).thenReturn(Arrays.asList(mockCard1).iterator());
        Mockito.when(mockDeck2.iterator()).thenReturn(Arrays.asList(mockCard2).iterator());
    }

    @Test
    public void testInit() {
        Game.init(mockUI1, mockUI2, "Player1", "Player2", mockDeck1, mockDeck2);

        assertEquals("Player1", Game.player1.getName());
        assertEquals("Player2", Game.player2.getName());
        assertEquals(1, Game.playingPlayer);
        assertTrue(Game.currentPhase instanceof UntapPhase);
        assertEquals(Game.player1, mockCard1.owner);
        assertEquals(Game.player1.library, mockCard1.zone);
        assertEquals(Game.player2, mockCard2.owner);
        assertEquals(Game.player2.library, mockCard2.zone);
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetPlayingPlayer() {
        Game.player1 = mockPlayer1;
        Game.player2 = mockPlayer2;
        Game.playingPlayer = 1;
        assertEquals(mockPlayer1, Game.getPlayingPlayer());

        Game.playingPlayer = 2;
        assertEquals(mockPlayer2, Game.getPlayingPlayer());
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetNonPlayingPlayer() {
        Game.player1 = mockPlayer1;
        Game.player2 = mockPlayer2;
        Game.playingPlayer = 1;
        assertEquals(mockPlayer2, Game.getNonPlayingPlayer());

        Game.playingPlayer = 2;
        assertEquals(mockPlayer1, Game.getNonPlayingPlayer());
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetOtherPlayer() {
        Game.player1 = mockPlayer1;
        Game.player2 = mockPlayer2;
        assertEquals(mockPlayer2, Game.getOtherPlayer(mockPlayer1));
        assertEquals(mockPlayer1, Game.getOtherPlayer(mockPlayer2));
    }

    @Test
    public void testGivePriorityToCurrentPlayer() {
        Game.player1 = mockPlayer1;
        Game.player2 = mockPlayer2;
        Game.stack = Mockito.mock(Stack.class);

        Mockito.when(mockPlayer1.letPlayerSpeak()).thenReturn(false);
        Mockito.when(mockPlayer2.letPlayerSpeak()).thenReturn(false);
        Mockito.when(Game.stack.empty()).thenReturn(true);

        Game.givePriorityToCurrentPlayer();

        Mockito.verify(mockPlayer1, Mockito.atLeastOnce()).letPlayerSpeak();
        Mockito.verify(mockPlayer2, Mockito.atLeastOnce()).letPlayerSpeak();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Mocks and Stubs**: The test suite uses Mockito to create mock objects for dependencies like `UserInterface`, `CardCollection`, `Player`, and `Card`.
- **Setup Method**: The `setUp` method initializes the mock objects and sets up any necessary behavior.
- **Test Methods**: Each method in the `Game` class has a corresponding test method that verifies its behavior.
- **Assertions**: The tests use assertions to check that the methods behave as expected, such as returning the correct player or setting up the game state correctly.
- **Mock Behavior**: For methods like `givePriorityToCurrentPlayer`, mock behavior is defined to simulate player actions and stack conditions.

This test suite should provide a good starting point for testing the `Game` class. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual implementations of the interfaces and classes used.
