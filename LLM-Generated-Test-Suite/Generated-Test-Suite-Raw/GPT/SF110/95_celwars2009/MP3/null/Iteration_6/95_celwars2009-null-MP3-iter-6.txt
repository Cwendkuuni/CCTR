To create a comprehensive JUnit 4 test suite for the `MP3` class, we need to consider testing the constructor and the `run` method. However, testing audio processing directly can be challenging due to the need for audio files and the side effects of audio playback. Instead, we can focus on testing the behavior of the class, such as ensuring that exceptions are handled properly and that the class can be instantiated without errors.

Below is a JUnit 4 test suite for the `MP3` class. Note that this test suite assumes the presence of a valid MP3 file named "test.mp3" in the working directory for testing purposes.

```java
import org.junit.*;
import javax.sound.sampled.*;
import java.io.*;

public class MP3Test {

    private static final String VALID_MP3_FILE = "test.mp3";
    private static final String INVALID_MP3_FILE = "invalid.mp3";

    @BeforeClass
    public static void setUpClass() {
        // Setup code if needed, e.g., creating test files
    }

    @AfterClass
    public static void tearDownClass() {
        // Cleanup code if needed, e.g., deleting test files
    }

    @Test
    public void testConstructorWithValidFile() {
        try {
            MP3 mp3 = new MP3(VALID_MP3_FILE);
            Assert.assertNotNull(mp3);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Assert.fail("Constructor threw an exception with a valid file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testConstructorWithInvalidFile() {
        try {
            MP3 mp3 = new MP3(INVALID_MP3_FILE);
            Assert.assertNotNull(mp3);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Assert.fail("Constructor threw an exception with an invalid file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testRunMethodWithValidFile() {
        try {
            MP3 mp3 = new MP3(VALID_MP3_FILE);
            mp3.run();
            // Since run() doesn't return anything, we assume no exceptions means success
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Assert.fail("Run method threw an exception with a valid file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testRunMethodWithInvalidFile() {
        try {
            MP3 mp3 = new MP3(INVALID_MP3_FILE);
            mp3.run();
            // Since run() doesn't return anything, we assume no exceptions means success
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // We expect an exception here, so the test should pass
            Assert.assertTrue(true);
        }
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- The test suite includes tests for both valid and invalid MP3 files.
- The `run` method is tested indirectly by calling it and checking for exceptions.
- The test suite assumes that the `test.mp3` file exists and is a valid MP3 file. You may need to adjust the file paths or names based on your environment.
- The `INVALID_MP3_FILE` is expected to cause an exception, which is considered a successful test case for handling errors gracefully.
- The `run` method is called directly for testing purposes, but in a real-world scenario, you might want to test it in a more controlled environment or mock the audio system components.
