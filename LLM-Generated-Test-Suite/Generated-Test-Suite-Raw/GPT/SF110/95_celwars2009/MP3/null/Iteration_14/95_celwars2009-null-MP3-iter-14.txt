To create a comprehensive JUnit 4 test suite for the `MP3` class, we need to consider testing the constructor and the `run` method. However, testing audio playback functionality can be challenging due to its dependency on external resources (audio files) and hardware (audio output devices). 

Below is a basic test suite that checks the initialization of the `MP3` class and attempts to run the `run` method. Note that this test suite will require an actual MP3 file to be present at a specified path for the tests to execute meaningfully. Additionally, since the `run` method is executed in a separate thread, we need to handle thread synchronization for testing purposes.

```java
import org.junit.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import java.io.File;

public class MP3Test {

    private static final String TEST_MP3_FILE = "test.mp3"; // Ensure this file exists for testing

    @BeforeClass
    public static void setUpBeforeClass() throws Exception {
        // Create a dummy MP3 file for testing if necessary
        File file = new File(TEST_MP3_FILE);
        if (!file.exists()) {
            // Create a dummy file or copy a valid MP3 file to this location
            // For the sake of this example, we assume the file exists
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testMP3Constructor() {
        MP3 mp3 = new MP3(TEST_MP3_FILE);
        assertNotNull("MP3 object should not be null", mp3);
        assertEquals("Filename should be set correctly", TEST_MP3_FILE, mp3.filename);
    }

    @Test
    public void testRunMethod() {
        MP3 mp3 = new MP3(TEST_MP3_FILE);
        try {
            // Wait for the thread to finish
            mp3.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            fail("Thread was interrupted");
        }
        // Since the run method does not return a value or change state that we can check,
        // we rely on the absence of exceptions as a basic test of functionality.
        // More sophisticated testing would require mocking or additional instrumentation.
    }

    @AfterClass
    public static void tearDownAfterClass() throws Exception {
        // Clean up the dummy MP3 file if necessary
        File file = new File(TEST_MP3_FILE);
        if (file.exists()) {
            file.delete();
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **File Dependency**: The test suite assumes the existence of a file named `test.mp3`. You need to ensure this file is available in your test environment.
- **Thread Handling**: The `run` method is executed in a separate thread. We use `join()` to wait for the thread to complete before asserting outcomes.
- **Exception Handling**: The test checks for exceptions during execution as a basic validation of the `run` method.
- **Mocking and Advanced Testing**: For more comprehensive testing, consider using mocking frameworks like Mockito to simulate audio system behavior, or refactor the code to make it more testable.

This test suite provides a basic framework and can be expanded with more sophisticated checks as needed.
